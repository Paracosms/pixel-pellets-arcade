# Pixel Pellets Arcade
Pixel Pellets Arcade is a bullet hell boss rush game. Bosses will shoot at you, and you have to deflect the bullets back at the boss to deal damage and kill them.

## Don't get hit, or your resolution will decrease!
The core feature of this game revolves around changing your screen size dynamically as you play. If you get hit, your resolution decreases.

In the future I plan on adding:
- A way to increase your resolution slowly through graze
- Music for each boss
